**Software Engineer, 14 Years** | Backend & Distributed Systems | Extreme Ownership | Building in the Agentic Era

I build distributed systems that don't break at 3am. Backend-focused Software Engineer with 14+ years shipping production software. Currently obsessed with agentic development — leveraging AI as a force multiplier while maintaining engineering rigor.

## 🔥 What I'm Working On

**[IntexuraOS](https://github.com/pbuchman/intexuraos)** — AI-native personal operating system

- **24 services** | **338 API endpoints** | **327K lines of TypeScript**
- Multi-provider LLM orchestration (5 providers, 17 models, "council of experts" pattern)
- WhatsApp-first interaction with autonomous code execution
- **95%+ test coverage** | 21 CI verification scripts | Extreme Ownership mindset

> Building AI agents that use apps as tools — not another app with AI bolted on.

## 🎯 How I Work

**Extreme Ownership doctrine:** If the code broke, I own it. If requirements were unclear, I should have clarified. No excuses.

**Engineering rigor:**
- 95%+ branch coverage required — every commit validated
- Strict TypeScript mode — no `any`, no surprises
- Infrastructure as Code — if it's not in Terraform, it doesn't exist
- CI enforcement — "my part passes" is not a valid state

**Agentic development:**
- AI models as a "council of experts" — each has strengths
- Abstract behind contracts, route intelligently, synthesize results
- Ship faster while maintaining quality standards
